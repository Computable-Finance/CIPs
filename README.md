## Contributing

 1. Review [CIP-0](CIPS/cip-0.md).
 2. Fork the repository by clicking "Fork" in the top right.
 3. Add [github issue](https://github.com/Computable-Finance/CIPs/issues) to community to discuss your proposal.
 4. Add your CIP to your fork of the repository. There is a [template CIP here](cip-X.md).
 5. Submit a Pull Request to CoFix's [CIPs repository](https://github.com/Computable-Finance/CIPs/).
 6. CIP is in `Drafted` status and waiting for editor's review to moved to `Proposed`, once `Proposed` the editor will create a voting link on [snapshot](https://snapshot.page/#/cofix).
 7. The community starts to vote the proposal, the result is either `Approved` or `Rejected`.
 8. After `Approved`, the development team will implement the proposal.

Your first PR should be a first draft of the final CIP. An editor will manually review the first PR for a new CIP and assign it a number before merging it. Make sure you include a `vote` header with the URL to a new voting on [CoFix snapshot](https://snapshot.page/#/cofix/) where people can vote the CIP as a whole, and include a `discussion` header with the URL to the discussion on [CoFix github issue](https://github.com/Computable-Finance/CIPs/issues)

If your CIP requires images, the image files should be included in a subdirectory of the `assets` folder for that CIP as follow: `assets/cip-X` (for cip **X**). When linking to an image in the CIP, use relative links such as `../assets/cip-X/image.png`.

When you believe your CIP is mature and ready to progress past the Drafted phase, you should ask to have your issue added to the next governance call where it can be discussed for inclusion in a future platform upgrade. If the community agrees to include it, the CIP editors will update the state of your CIP to 'Approved'.

## CIP Statuses
